# React Rails Chat App

### User Stories/Features
1. When users land at the app, they are presented with a single input form prompting them to create an alias for use in the chatrooms. If the alias is not unique among the users currently using the chat rooms, an error appears.

2. Once users have created an alias it is displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the app. Users then see a list of existing chatrooms.

3. Users can create chatrooms via a form with one input (chatroom name)

4. Users can join existing chatrooms where they can chat with other users in the chatroom.

5. In a chatroom, users see the number of users present in the room.

6. In the chatroom, users can type messages to be seen by other users.

7. In the chatroom, users can see messages sent by other users.

8. In the chatroom, users will see the other usersâ€™ alias next to the messages they send.

9. Users can leave a chatroom
